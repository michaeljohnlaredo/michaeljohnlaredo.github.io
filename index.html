			   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fortnite</b> is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. 
			   It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save
			   the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with 
			   fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the 
			   last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. The first
			   two-game modes were released in 2017 as early access titles and Creative was released on December 6, 2018. Save the World is available 
			   only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and Creative released for those platforms, in addition for 
			   Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices.
While all game modes have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale became a resounding success, drawing in more than 125 million
 players in less than a year and earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and since has become a cultural phenomenon.
